# Donkey Kong Jr. Math
WIP disassembly of Donkey Kong Jr. Math for the NES

For WSL2 Ubuntu. Probably also works on actual Linux.

Run `./install` to download and set up cc65

Run `./configure` to generate disassembly

Run `./assemble` to make a new rom from disasm files

Still incredibly wip, i do not have enough knowledge to know why parts do and dont work

I have provided a FCEUX CDL and basic PRG and CHR mappings in `info.cfg`. They can generate the asm fine, and ive found an NROM template.
Aside from that, however, i have next to no idea what to do from here.
